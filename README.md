# tradingStrategy
Since the moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price.
I always wanted to make it some advanced strategy based on the exponaential moving averages when the stock consolidated and picks up the the move in a perticular direction.
After analysing the siedways move i have noted some many valuable patterns and converted it into a strategy as in the code.
