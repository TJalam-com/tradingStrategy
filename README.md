# tradingStrategy
Since the moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price.<br>
I always wanted to make it some advanced strategy based on the exponential moving averages when the stock consolidated and picks up the the move in a perticular direction.<br>
After analysing the siedways move I have noted some valuable patterns and converted it into a strategy as in the code. <br>
